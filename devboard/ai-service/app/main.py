"""ai-service — context-aware AI over Server-Sent Events.

Flow per request:
  1. Pull the project's tasks from the backend (task context).
  2. Build a prompt that grounds the model in the current project state.
  3. Stream the model's answer back to the caller as SSE.

This is the one place a synchronous service-to-service call is correct — the AI
cannot answer without the task context, so we pay that cost in the request path.

No auth: this DevBoard has no login, so the service is open within the cluster
(the Gateway only exposes it under /api/ai).
